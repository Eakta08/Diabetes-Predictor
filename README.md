# Diabetes-Predictor
This project involves the implementation of various ML models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Navies Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBoost, and others, along with the selection of the best performance model based on various evaluation metrics. Then using it in the web app to predict whether or not an individual has diabetes.
